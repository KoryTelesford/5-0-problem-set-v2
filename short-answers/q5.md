# Question
When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer
You could use innerHTMl to create new HTML when you want to add attributes to DOM, and its more simpler and cleaner then .createElement. 
You would want to use .createElement to keep existing references to DOM elements when appending elements.
